📘 DETAILED SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

LevelUP – DETAILED SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

LevelUp is a gamified fitness and wellness tracking system designed to motivate users through RPG-style progression, daily quests, automatic penalties, and reward unlocking. Inspired by progression systems similar to Solo Leveling, the platform turns real-life health habits into actionable “leveling” mechanics.

The system encourages users to complete daily tasks—such as completing workouts, eating healthy meals, or hitting activity targets—to increase their XP, advance their level, and maintain streak bonuses. The central mechanic is the Daily Challenge, which must be completed every day to avoid penalties that reduce XP of the user.

💠 CORE SYSTEM CONCEPTS
1. User Progression

Each user starts at Level 1 with baseline XP. Users earn experience by:

•	Completing daily challenges

•	Logging workouts

•	Logging meals

•	Completing quests

•	Maintaining streaks

As XP increases, the user levels up — unlocking more tasks, earning higher XP, gaining titles, and improving their account status.

Users who consistently fail daily challenges accumulate Penalty Points, decreasing performance in future XP gains.

2. Daily Challenge System (Main Feature)

Every day at midnight, the system assigns a new Daily Challenge to each user. Challenges vary by intensity and type, such as:

•	“Burn 200 calories today.”

•	“Complete a 20-minute workout.”

•	“Log 2 healthy meals.”

•	“Walk 5,000 steps.”

Daily Challenges must be completed before the day ends.

✔ Completing the daily challenge:

	•	Grants XP
	
	•	Increases the Streak
	
	•	May unlock a reward
	
	•	Boosts the user’s sense of progress

✖ Failing the daily challenge:

Automatically triggers a Penalty, such as:

	•	XP deduction
	
	•	Streak reset

This mechanism promotes consistent daily engagement, similar to daily quests in RPG games.

⸻

3. Workouts Module

Users can log workouts, including:

	•	Workout name
	
	•	Duration
	
	•	Intensity
	
	•	Estimated calories burned

XP calculations are performed based on the difficulty and duration. Workouts can also count toward Daily Challenges or contribute to the completion of quests.

⸻

4. Meal Logging Module

To promote healthier eating habits, the system allows users to log meals with attributes such as:

	•	Meal type (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack)
	
	•	Calorie count
	
	•	Whether it is classified as healthy

Healthy meals reward bonus XP, and unhealthy meals may provide no XP.

Meals may also be part of Daily Challenges (example: “Log 3 healthy meals today”).

⸻

5. Quests

Quests function as longer-term tasks compared to daily challenges.

Examples include:

	•	“Complete 5 workouts this week.”
	
	•	“Maintain a 7-day streak.”
	
	•	“Burn 5,000 calories in one month.”

Quests offer:

	•	XP
	
	•	Exclusive rewards
	
	•	Titles or account perks

Failing a quest will result in loss of XP.

⸻

6. Rewards System

Users receive rewards for completing milestones. Rewards may include:

	•	Badges
	
	•	Titles
	
	•	Cosmetic achievements

Rewards are stored in each user’s inventory once claimed. Some rewards unlock automatically upon reaching certain levels.

⸻

7. Streak System

The system track how many consecutive days the user completes Daily Challenges.

Each day the streak increases:

	•	Gain more XP
	
	•	Greater chance of unlocking new titles

Failing a daily challenge:

	•	Resets the Streak
	
	•	Applies a Streak Penalty

High streaks create strong habit-reinforcement by rewarding consistency.

⸻

8. Penalty System (Failure Management)

Penalties are applied automatically when:

	•	The user fails a Daily Challenge
	
	•	The user fails a Quest
	
	•	The user breaks a Streak

Possible penalties include:
	
	•	XP deduction
	
	•	Streak reset

Penalties escalate XP deductions the more often the user fails, emphasizing habit-building and responsibility.
